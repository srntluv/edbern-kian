hello, love ! 
<br> 
<br> 
this is like a letter lang talaga hehe, ginawa ko lang na website para may twist :p  im going to make something like this ulit soon
 pero with more effort na hehehehe 

<br>
<br> 
Anyway, saw your reposts, baby.  I hope you're feeling okay right at this moment. I just wanna let you know na you can always rant to me. 
I may not be able to know the right words to say, but I can listen hehehe. Life's really hard, love, but I hope you'll find reasons to
stay :) I know na you don't want to deal with it anymore because super draining siya and you want distractions na lang pero I hope soon you will 
be able to face it until it gets better hanggang sa mawala na :) I hope you will heal from all the pain and finally love yourself.  

<br> 
<br> 
Will always be here for you, baby !!! <3 you're the best
